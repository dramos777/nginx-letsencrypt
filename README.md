# nginx-letsencrypt

This project sets up an Nginx server with SSL enabled using certificates generated by Let's Encrypt. It also includes support for Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

## How to Use

1. **Generate the initial `certs` directory with self-signed certificates and Diffie-Hellman parameters:**

   ```bash
   bash scripts/certs-create.sh
   ```
2. **Request SSL certificates from Let's Encrypt:**
   ```bash
   bash scripts/letsencrypt-certs-generate.sh
   ```
3. **Configure your Nginx server:**
Edit the Nginx configuration file to define your server settings, Upstreams, and SSL certificate paths:
   ```bash
   vim config/nginx.conf
   ```
4. **Deploy your application with the configured Nginx server.**
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```
